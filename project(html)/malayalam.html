    <p>Malayalam cinema, also referred to as Mollywood, is a segment of Indian cinema dedicated to producing films in the Malayalam language, primarily spoken in Kerala and the Lakshadweep islands. It encompasses both the mainstream film industry and independent Malayalam films. Known for its strong storytelling, powerful performances, and social themes, Malayalam cinema has received critical acclaim and is often regarded as one of India's most notable film industries.
The first Malayalam feature film was Vigathakumaran, a silent film directed and produced by J. C. Daniel. Production started in 1928, and it was released at the Capitol Theatre in Thiruvananthapuram on 23 October 1930. The first talkie in Malayalam was Balan (1938) directed by S. Nottani. During the 1920s, the Malayalam film industry was based in Thiruvananthapuram, although the film industry started to develop and flourish by the late 1940s. Later the industry shifted to Madras (now Chennai). By the late 1980s, the industry returned to Kerala,[5] establishing Kochi as its hub with most production and post-production facilities located there and most of the film stars including Mammootty and Mohanlal living in the city.
As of 2024, Malayalam cinema has earned numerous accolades at the National Film Awards, including 14 for Best Actor, 6 for Best Actress, 13 for Best Film, and 13 for Best Director.[10] Malayalam cinema garnered international recognition, with Elippathayam (1982) winning the Sutherland Trophy at the London Film Festival, and being named the Most Original Imaginative Film of 1982 by the British Film Institute. Additionally, Marana Simhasanam won the prestigious Cam√©ra d'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.
Several Malayalam films have been India's official entries for the Best Foreign Language Film category at the Academy Awards, including Rajiv Anchal's Guru (1997), Salim Ahamed's Adaminte Makan Abu (2011), Lijo Jose Pellissery's Jallikkattu (2019) and Jude Anthany Joseph's 2018 (2023). Other globally acclaimed films include Chemmeen (1965), which received a Certificate of Merit at the Chicago International Film Festival, and a gold medal at the Cannes Film Festival for Best Cinematography. Swaham (1994) won the Bronze Rosa Camuna at the Bergamo Film Meeting in Italy. Malayalam cinema has also produced India's first 3D film, My Dear Kuttichathan (1984).The first CinemaScope film produced in Malayalam was Thacholi Ambu (1978).</p>
